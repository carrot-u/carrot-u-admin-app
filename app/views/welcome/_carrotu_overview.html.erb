          We have great employees at Instacart who are strongly motivated to move from non-technical roles into
          engineering positions. Theyâ€™re going to do it with or without our help. Attending a traditional coding
          bootcamp usually involves leaving their job, which means Instacart loses a great employee. They also
          have to pay A LOT of money, which is difficult without a job. This program is a win for the company and the
          students. Participants gain new skills while keeping their existing jobs, and Instacart can retain ambitious
          and valued employees.

        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Being a new engineer can be overwhelming at times, particularly in a fast moving company. Hiring
          junior engineers who are not familiar with the company means they have two learning curves. Tapping into a
          market of potential engineers who already know a lot about Instacart makes it possible for those people to
          have an easier transition and to be able to make meaningful contributions as quickly.

          Instacart is full of talented engineers, all of whom enjoy sharing their knowledge and skills
          with others. Staffing our bootcamp with volunteer engineers with a passion for teaching allows them to
          exercise and grow in this area.
